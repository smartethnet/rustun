# Example server configuration file for Rustun VPN

# Address and port to listen on
# 0.0.0.0 listens on all interfaces
# Use 127.0.0.1 for local only

[crypto_config]
# Encryption method (choose one):
# - chacha20poly1305: High security, good performance (recommended)
# - aes256gcm: High security, hardware acceleration on supported CPUs
# - xor: Fast but low security (for testing only)
# - plain: No encryption (for debugging only)

# Alternative encryption options (uncomment to use):
# aes256gcm = "your-secret-key-here"
# xor = "your-secret-key-here"

# Path to the routes configuration file
# Can be absolute or relative to the working directory

# The routes file will be watched for changes
# When modified, routes will be automatically reloaded
